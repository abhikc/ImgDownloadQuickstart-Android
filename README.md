# ImgDownloadQuickstart-Android

This example helps demonstrate downloading a list of blobs from Kinvey.

1. fetches all of blob names from _blob collection
2. makes a call to Kinvey via Resource.getUriForResource() for every blob listed
3. samples the image downloaded and resizes to 512x512 if its too big
